# /REG/Reports

App for compiling reports on daily activities.

## Why?

There are many activities carried out during the day and it becomes difficult to keep track of them. Furthermore, the internal portal for compiling reports is quite slow, which makes compilation tedious.

## How?

The application shows the tickets assigned to the user, who can record the processing times and, via a dynamically constructed link, record the reports complete with timing, ticket, order and description.

> For privacy reasons, the API endpoint for reading tickets is retrieved from environment variables.
